# Dice Roller App
This is an app which has a dice in it. You can use this app when you are playing a game requiring a dice and you do not have a physical dice or you have lost one.
This basically calculates a random number in the backend and corresponding to the number shown it displays a image of that number.<br>
This was a funa app to built and a good one for all those starting with the app development.
<br>
This app was built while i was learning how to code in kotlin.
Google had organized #30DaysofKotlin from 6 May 2020-7 Jun 2020 where participants were provided with some assets.<br>
These assets taught us with the basics of kotlin, some basic appas and some intermidiate level apps covering concepts accordingly.<br>
